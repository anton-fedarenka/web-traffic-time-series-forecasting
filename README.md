# Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting

This repo containes the example of the solution of the problem of forecasting the future values of multiple time series.
The dataset is a time series generated by daily views of approximately 145,000 Wikipedia articles over a period of nearly 3 years.
Data taken from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting"> Kaggle competition </a>.
For evaluaton of forecast accuracy SMAPE value is used. 

Due to limited computing budgets, it was not possible to use the entire
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting"> Kaggle dataset </a> 
to build very accurate models or compete for outstanding results. 
Thus, the main goal of the work was precisely to demonstrate the existing skills and 
understanding of approaches to handling such problems. 
Based on this, the studied models were trained on a limited data set of 10 time series, 
logarithmically equidistant from each other in terms of the total number of views.

The study is splitted in 3 parts: 
- [data_visualization.ipynb](data_visualization.ipynb) is the first step of data handling, preprocessing, visualization, etc. Moreover, for the time series formed by the median values of visits to all Wikipedia pages, several regression models have been built and studied;
- [linear_models.ipynb](linear_models.ipynb) provides an overview of various linear models for time series forecasting;
- [waveNet.ipynb](waveNet.ipynb) demonstrates the use of the WaveNet architecture for time series forecasting.
